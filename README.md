# Osciloscope
Making a simple osciloscpe with an STMF103RB, using the ADC in CCR mode log and send data to my laptop. 
Need to use a python script to graph the data, but the microcontroller does everything else.

Decent substitute for simple osciloscope readings. Although not as accurate as an actual osciloscope it's good enough to see function behavior and trends.

Pretty helfpul in doing some of the ECE labs at home or at least trying to understand some of them beforehand
